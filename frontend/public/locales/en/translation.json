    "HomeText1": "of ​​the exchange, which the <b>Kongshavn Videregående Skole</b> in Oslo has been organizing for years, not only includes new and exciting everyday experiences that the students can gain abroad, in this case in Berlin, but also getting to know the special historical theme of Berlin itself - as a focal point of East/West and at the same time the opportunity to experience a lively, changing city first hand.",

    "HomeText5": "Language opens doors - doors to culture and to specialist knowledge. Research clearly shows that if language and specialist content are learned at the same time, you learn both the subject and the language better. With the new language, you not only learn the specialist content, but also the language to describe learning and what you have learned, you learn new learning and reading strategies - and in this way you learn for life. That is why I started the „a school year in Berlin“ project in 2007. The Norwegian students who go to school in Berlin for a year as part of this project are learning for life. The students' learning results after the year in Berlin are excellent. Their Abitur results are also excellent.",
    "HomeText6": "But learning is hard work. Students who have to learn both the language and the subjects have to work twice as hard - that's why it's important to have a host family that can create a good learning foundation. Our students have to learn everyday language first. This also includes cultural norms - for example, how do you express yourself to be nice and polite in German? What language and phrases do you need to describe yourself? What means of communication (listening, understanding and being able to ask questions) do you need to understand that, for example, your host parents want something from you? Everything has to be learned. That's why we are very grateful that host parents agree to take our students in. I was a host mother for a German student in Norway myself and know what worries and joys - not least joys - this brings.",
